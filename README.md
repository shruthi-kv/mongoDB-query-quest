1. What is MongoDB, and how does it differ from traditional relational databases?
Answer: MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for dynamic schemas. Traditional relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns, enforcing strict relationships via foreign keys.

Key Differences:
Schema Flexibility: MongoDB doesn’t require a predefined schema, making it ideal for evolving applications, whereas RDBMS requires a fixed schema.
Data Model: MongoDB uses documents within collections; RDBMS uses tables with rows and columns.
Scalability: MongoDB scales horizontally (via sharding), distributing data across servers, while RDBMS typically scales vertically (adding more power to a single server).
Joins: MongoDB avoids complex joins, embedding related data in documents, while RDBMS relies heavily on joins.
Use Case: MongoDB is suited for applications like content management systems or real-time analytics, while RDBMS excels in structured data scenarios like banking systems.



What are collections and documents in MongoDB?
Answer: In MongoDB, data is organized into collections and documents.

Collection: A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, analogous to a table in a relational database. It doesn’t enforce a schema, so documents within a collection can have different structures.
Document: A document is a single record within a collection, stored as a BSON object with key-value pairs. It’s akin to a row in a table but more flexible.
Example:

// Collection: "users"
{
  "_id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
Here, "users" is the collection, and the JSON object is a document. The _id field is a unique identifier automatically generated by MongoDB unless specified.


3. How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB?
Answer: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete—the fundamental operations for managing data. MongoDB provides a rich query language to perform these operations efficiently.

Create: Use insertOne() or insertMany() to add documents.
Read: Use find() for multiple documents or findOne() for a single document.
Update: Use updateOne() or updateMany() with operators like $set to modify data.
Delete: Use deleteOne() or deleteMany() to remove documents.
Code Example (Using MongoDB Node.js driver):

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

async function run() {
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('mydb');
    const collection = db.collection('users');

    // Create: Insert a single document
    await collection.insertOne({ name: 'Jane', age: 25, email: 'jane@example.com' });
    console.log('Document inserted');

    // Read: Find a document
    const user = await collection.findOne({ name: 'Jane' });
    console.log('Found user:', user);

    // Update: Modify the document
    await collection.updateOne({ name: 'Jane' }, { $set: { age: 26 } });
    console.log('Document updated');

    // Delete: Remove the document
    await collection.deleteOne({ name: 'Jane' });
    console.log('Document deleted');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}
run();
